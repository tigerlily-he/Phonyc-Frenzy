This is a team summer project (2015) I completed with four other high school students. We were part of NYC Generation Technology (renamed Startup Summer), a program for teaching tech entrepreneurship. 

We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a web version and Adobe PhoneGap Build for compiling to Android SDK. 

From our business plan:

Phonyc Frenzy. Learn faster. Speak better. Score higher.

**Description:** Phonyc Frenzy is an app that enables immigrants to attain post-secondary education through the strengthening of their English and native language skills. We serve English Language Learners (ELL) students, who immigrated to the United States within the last three to five years, and their educators. Our vision is a world where ELL students of all backgrounds integrate smoothly into the American education system and perform equally or better than their native English-speaking counterparts.

**Mission Statement:** To provide teenage ELL students with skills to prepare for college admission exams by offering reliable translations, vocabulary through games, and a variety of ways to customize flashcards, thereby reinforcing their knowledge and confidence.
